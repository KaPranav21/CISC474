    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Education:<h2> 
        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and what sets me apart is that I'm graduating one year ahead of schedule. 
        My dedication to my studies and the subject matter has enabled me to excel in my academic journey.</p>

        <h2>Fitness and Sports:<h2> 
        <p>Beyond the world of coding and algorithms, I'm also a fitness enthusiast. You'll often find me casually lifting weights, 
        challenging myself to become stronger both physically and mentally. Additionally, I'm a huge basketball fan and enjoy hitting 
        the court whenever I can. The thrill of competition and teamwork on the basketball court mirrors my approach to problem-solving 
        in the digital realm.</p>
        
        <h2>Traveling:<h2> 
        <p>One of my favorite pastimes is embarking on trips to cities near and far. Exploring new cultures, cuisines, and landscapes
        fuels my sense of adventure and curiosity. These experiences have broadened my horizons and enriched my perspective, both in life
        and in my studies.</p>
